💡 Let's innovate, explore, and make a positive impact together. Feel free to reach out, and let's embark on this exciting journey of data-driven discovery!

Thanks for connecting! 🌟

## Objective of project
The main objective of this project is to explore different methods in exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. In the project, you can find the following:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Model development

## Dataset Credit
The data was collected from [realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/) and special thanks to [Ahmed Shahriar Sakib](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedshahriarsakib) for the efforts of mataining the dataset in Kaggle.

More details about the dataset can be found: [USA Real Estate Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset)

## Conclusion
This exercise has mainly focused on EDA and feature engineering practices. After cleaning and preprocessing the given dataset, we then built a basic random forest model to estimate the house price. As we can see from the final results, we are able to obtain a pretty decent performance.

We can improve the performance by further hyperparameters tuning, instead of using default values for the model.

Please let me know your thoughts on this notebook, I would like to hear any advice and suggestions. Thanks for reading! Happy learning!
